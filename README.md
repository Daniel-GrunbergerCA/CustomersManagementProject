# CustomersManagementProject
A project as part of one of the courses in college. It implements interation with google api, where we upload barcodes from products, which are scanned and sent to the application.
The application shows many info about the products and purchases, graphs etc. It also uses some ML to give suggestions about future purchases.


Please don't copy our code :)
